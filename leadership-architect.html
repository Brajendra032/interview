Code Review Guidelines & Process
===============================

1. CODE REVIEW PRINCIPLES
   - Code reviews are about improving code quality and sharing knowledge
   - Be respectful and constructive in feedback

Deployment Planning & Release Management Framework
================================================

1. RELEASE PLANNING PROCESS

   Pre-Planning Phase:
   ‚ñ° Define release objectives and success criteria
   ‚ñ° Identify stakeholders and communication plan
   ‚ñ° Assess technical feasibility and dependencies
   ‚ñ° Estimate effort and timeline
   ‚ñ° Identify risks and mitigation strategies

   Planning Phase:
   ‚ñ° Create detailed deployment checklist
   ‚ñ° Define rollback procedures
   ‚ñ° Prepare monitoring and alerting
   ‚ñ° Schedule deployment windows
   ‚ñ° Coordinate with other teams (DBA, infra, security)

2. DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES

   Blue-Green Deployment:
   + Zero downtime deployment
   + Instant rollback capability
   + Full environment validation
   - Requires double infrastructure capacity
   - More complex routing configuration

   Canary Deployment:
   + Gradual risk reduction
   + Real user validation
   + Easy rollback (traffic shifting)
   - Slower rollout process
   - Requires sophisticated traffic management

   Rolling Deployment:
   + Minimal resource overhead
   + Simple to implement
   + Works with any infrastructure
   - No instant rollback
   - Potential inconsistency during rollout

3. DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

   Pre-Deployment:
   ‚ñ° Feature flags configured and tested
   ‚ñ° Database migrations prepared and tested
   ‚ñ° Configuration management updated
   ‚ñ° Infrastructure provisioning completed
   ‚ñ° Security review completed
   ‚ñ° Performance testing completed
   ‚ñ° Documentation updated

   During Deployment:
   ‚ñ° Establish deployment command center
   ‚ñ° Implement deployment freeze if needed
   ‚ñ° Monitor key metrics and alerts
   ‚ñ° Execute smoke tests after each phase
   ‚ñ° Validate data integrity
   ‚ñ° Update DNS/load balancers if needed

   Post-Deployment:
   ‚ñ° Conduct post-mortem review
   ‚ñ° Update monitoring dashboards
   ‚ñ° Communicate success to stakeholders
   ‚ñ° Monitor for issues over next 24-48 hours
   ‚ñ° Clean up temporary resources

4. RISK MANAGEMENT

   Risk Assessment:
   - Business Impact: High/Medium/Low
   - Technical Complexity: High/Medium/Low
   - User Impact: High/Medium/Low
   - Rollback Difficulty: High/Medium/Low

   Mitigation Strategies:
   ‚ñ° Feature flags for instant disable
   ‚ñ° Circuit breakers for graceful degradation
   ‚ñ° Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
   ‚ñ° Automated rollback procedures
   ‚ñ° Gradual rollout with manual approval gates

5. COMMUNICATION PLAN

   Internal Communication:
   ‚ñ° Team standup updates
   ‚ñ° Slack/Teams deployment channel
   ‚ñ° Email updates to stakeholders
   ‚ñ° Incident response plan activation if needed

   External Communication:
   ‚ñ° Customer notification for major releases
   ‚ñ° Status page updates
   ‚ñ° Marketing coordination for feature launches

6. MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY

   Key Metrics to Monitor:
   - Application response times
   - Error rates and exceptions
   - Database connection pools
   - Infrastructure utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Business metrics (conversions, transactions)

   Alerting Strategy:
   ‚ñ° Critical alerts: Page on-call engineer
   ‚ñ° Warning alerts: Notify team via Slack
   ‚ñ° Info alerts: Log for post-mortem analysis

7. ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

   Automated Rollback:
   ‚ñ° Blue-green: Switch traffic back instantly
   ‚ñ° Canary: Gradually reduce traffic to new version
   ‚ñ° Feature flags: Disable problematic features
   ‚ñ° Database: Rollback migrations if possible

   Manual Rollback:
   ‚ñ° Documented step-by-step procedures
   ‚ñ° Tested rollback scenarios
   ‚ñ° Backup restoration procedures
   ‚ñ° Communication templates for rollback

8. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

   Post-Mortem Process:
   ‚ñ° What went well?
   ‚ñ° What could be improved?
   ‚ñ° Action items with owners and deadlines
   ‚ñ° Lessons learned documentation

   Metrics to Track:
   - Deployment frequency
